## 🌱 Introduction
The Amazon Rainforest, often referred to as the "lungs of the Earth," plays a crucial role in the global ecosystem. This project aims to analyze the environmental impact on the Amazon Rainforest using satellite data from Google Sentinel-2. By leveraging advanced data analysis techniques, we seek to provide insights into the extent of deforestation, its impact on biodiversity, and the resulting carbon emissions.

## 🌐 Data Sources
Google Sentinel-2 Data: Provides high-resolution satellite imagery essential for detailed analysis.
Global Forest Change Dataset: Offers comprehensive data on forest cover and changes over time.
## 🔬 Methodology
Data Collection:

Acquire satellite images from Google Sentinel-2.
Obtain forest cover data from the Global Forest Change Dataset.
Preprocessing:

Clean and preprocess the satellite images to ensure they are suitable for analysis.
Integrate various datasets to create a unified dataset for analysis.
Analysis:

Perform deforestation analysis using image processing techniques.
Assess the impact on biodiversity hotspots by overlaying satellite data with known biodiversity regions.
Calculate carbon emissions resulting from deforestation activities.
Visualization:

Use tools like QGIS and Python libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn) to create visual representations of the data.
Develop interactive maps to visualize deforestation trends and affected areas.
## 📊 Analysis
Deforestation Analysis:

Analyze satellite images to identify deforested areas.
Track deforestation trends over different time periods.
Biodiversity Impact:

Overlay deforestation data with biodiversity hotspot maps.
Quantify the impact on various species and ecosystems.
Carbon Emissions:

Estimate the amount of carbon released due to deforestation.
Use carbon stock data and deforestation rates for calculations.
